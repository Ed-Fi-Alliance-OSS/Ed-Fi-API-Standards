# Ed-Fi-API-Standards

This repository provides documentation and guidance on building Ed-Fi compatible
API applications. Also see
[Ed-Fi-Standard](https://github.com/Ed-Fi-Alliance-OSS/Ed-Fi-Standard) for
official Ed-Fi Data Standard, which informs but remains distinct from the core
API Standard.

The canonical versions of this guidance are in Ed-Fi Tech Docs; this repository
has been created to provide greater transparency and improved development
practices for changes to the standards and normative guidance. Related content
