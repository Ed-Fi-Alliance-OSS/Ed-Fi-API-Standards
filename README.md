# Ed-Fi-API-Standards

[![OpenSSF Scorecard](https://api.securityscorecards.dev/projects/github.com/Ed-Fi-Alliance-OSS/Ed-Fi-API-Standards/badge)](https://securityscorecards.dev/viewer/?uri=github.com/Ed-Fi-Alliance-OSS/Ed-Fi-API-Standards)

The [Ed-Fi Alliance](https://www.ed-fi.org) coordinates and publishes
community-led standards for education and the exchange of education data.

The **Ed-Fi Data Standard** is the widely adopted, CEDS-aligned, open-source
data standard developed by the educational community for the betterment of the
community. The Ed-Fi Data Standard serves as the foundation for enabling
interoperability among secure data systems and contains a Unifying Data Model
designed to capture the meaning and inherent structure in the most important
information in the K–12 education enterprise. _[more

An **Ed-Fi compatible API application** creates a REST-based interface for data
exchange, where the messages conform to the Ed-Fi Data Standard. The **Ed-Fi
ODS/API** is the Ed-Fi Alliance's production-ready reference implementation of
an Ed-Fi API. Any interested party can build an alternate, compatible,
application, by adhering to the Open API specifications and guidance provided in
this space.

## Building an Ed-Fi API Application

What makes an application an "Ed-Fi (compatible) API"? An Ed-Fi API must:

* Implement the following [Open API specifications](api-specifications):
  * Resources API (current version: [5.0](api-specifications/resources/5.0))
  * Descriptors API (current version:
    [5.0](api-specifications/descriptors/5.0))
  * Discovery API (current version: [1.0](api-specifications/discovery/1.0),
    draft revision: [2.0](api-specifications/discovery/2.0-draft))
* And, adhere all of the normative guidance in the [Ed-Fi API
  Guidelines](./api-guidelines/) (current version: [4.0](api-guidelines/v4.0/).
