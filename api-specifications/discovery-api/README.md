# Ed-Fi Discovery API

> [!NOTE]
> As a specification, this is still considered to be in PROPOSED status.

This refers to the information returned from an Ed-Fi API application's base
endpoint, for example https://api.ed-fi.org/v7.1/api. Before December 2023, this
did not formally have a name, and was sometimes called the "version endpoint".
The name Discovery API highlights that this API specification is (a) becoming a
standard, and (b) should be used by API clients to learn about the runtime
configuration and usage of the given API installation.
