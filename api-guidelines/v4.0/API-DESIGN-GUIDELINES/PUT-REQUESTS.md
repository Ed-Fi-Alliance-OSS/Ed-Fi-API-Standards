# PUT Requests

An HTTP PUT _must_ perform an idempotent update of an existing resource. PUT
performs a full replacement of the existing resource with the supplied value. A
PUT against a nonexistent resource _must not_ create a new resource under the
provided identifier. PUT is a _required_ verb for non-read-only Resources.

## Request URLs

The URL _must_ end with a unique identifier for the given item to be replaced. A
`PUT` request _could_ support query string parameters in the form of the natural
key that uniquely identifies the item to be modified.

> [!NOTE]
> The Ed-Fi Alliance's ODS/API Platform does not support updates by natural key,
> though other implementations could choose to do so.

## Request Headers

If the application supports [ETags](./REST-API.md#etags), then the ETag _must_
support the `If-Match` request header. Example:

`If-Match: 5250159352800270276`

## Request Body

The request body _must_ contain exactly one item to be saved in the API
application. It _should_ contain the unique identifier for the item to be
updated; if provided, it _must_ match the identifier from the URL.

See [Data Strictness](./DATA-STRICTNESS.md) for more information about
validation of the request body.

## Response Headers

The response _could_ contain a `Location` header with the URL of the modified
resource. This URL _must_ not have changed due to the modification made by the
`PUT` request. Example:

```none
Location: https://api.example.com/ed-fi/students/[identifier]
```

If the application supports [ETags](./REST-API.md#etags), then the ETag _must_
be provided in an `Etag` header. Example:

```none
Etag: 5250159352800270276
```

## Response Body

The response _could_ contain the item that has just been created, optionally
including the same [metadata](./GET-REQUESTS.md#metadata) used in a `GET`
response.

## Applicable Status Codes

The following status codes _must_ be supported for `POST` responses:

| Status Code | Meaning      | When to Use                                                                                            |
| ----------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 204         | No Content   | Successful PUT or DELETE request.                                                                      |
| 400         | Bad Request  | The request was invalid and cannot be completed. See the response body for specific validation errors. |
| 401         | Unauthorized | The request requires authentication. The OAuth bearer token was either not provided or is invalid.     |
| 403         | Forbidden    | The request cannot be completed in the current authorization context.                                  |
| 404         | NotFound     | The resource could not be found.                                                                       |
| 405         | Not Allowed  | Special cases where a verb is not allowed, for example in a read-only API.                             |
| 409         | Conflict     | The request cannot be completed because it would result in an invalid state.                           |
| 500         | Server Error | An unhandled error occurred on the server.                                                             |

If ETags are supported, then code `412` (Precondition Failed) _must_ also be
supported, when the item's current server-side ETag value does not match the
supplied If-Match header value in the request.

Other [HTTP status codes](./REST-API.md#status-codes) may be used as needed for
specific situations.
