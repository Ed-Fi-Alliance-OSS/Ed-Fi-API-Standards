The default response when retrieving the base endpoint on an Ed-Fi
implementation must be a JSON document that provides information about the
application version, supported data model(s), and URLs for additional metadata.
Historically, this root-level metadata resource was known as the "version
endpoint".

> [!TIP]
> The Discovery API is completely described in an
> [Open API 3 specification document](../../../api-specifications/discovery-api/).

The following sample JSON demonstrates a basic example with an optional
extension (TPDM).

```json
{
  "version": "7.0",
  "suite": "3",
  "dataModels": [
    {
      "name": "Ed-Fi",
      "version": "5.0.0",
      "informationalVersion": "The Ed-Fi Data Model 5.0"
    },
    {
      "name": "TPDM",
      "version": "1.1.0",
      "informationalVersion": "TPDM-Core"
    }
  ],
  "urls": {
    "dependencies": "https://api.ed-fi.org/v7.0/api/metadata/data/v3/dependencies",
    "openApiMetadata": "https://api.ed-fi.org/v7.0/api/metadata/",
    "oauth": "https://api.ed-fi.org/v7.0/api/oauth/token",
    "dataManagementApi": "https://api.ed-fi.org/v7.0/api/data/v3/",
  }
}
```

While the `suite` string traditionally differentiated between ODS/API 2.x and
3.x+, it could also be used for alternate implementations. For example, a third
party developing an alternate Ed-Fi API implementation should _not_ use an Ed-Fi
suite number here (2, 3). Instead, use a custom value that helps the API client
know which software they are interacting with; this may be helpful when
debugging an unexpected response to an HTTP request.

Other standard values that can appear in the `urls` include the following, which
refer to specific features:

```json
"xsdMetadata": "https://api.ed-fi.org/v7.0/api/metadata/xsd",
"changeQueries": "https://api.ed-fi.org/v7.0/api/changeQueries/v1/",
"composites": "https://api.ed-fi.org/v7.0/api/composites/v1/",
"identity": "https://api.ed-fi.org/v7.0/api/identity/v2/"
```

The _required_ URLs are further described in the following sections.

#### Dependencies

All implementations of an Ed-Fi API _should_ expose an endpoint for dependency
metadata.  This endpoint will provide developers with the data needed to load
resources in the appropriate order. The endpoint _should_ have a JSON
implementation and optional a GraphML implementation.  A sample of the JSON
output is below:

```json
[
  {
    "resource": "/ed-fi/absenceEventCategoryDescriptors",
    "order": 1,
    "operations": [
      "Create"
    ]
  },
  {
    "resource": "/ed-fi/academicHonorCategoryDescriptors",
    "order": 1,
    "operations": [
      "Create"
    ]
  },
  â€¦
  {
    "resource": "/tpdm/surveySectionResponsePersonTargetAssociations",
    "order": 22,
    "operations": [
      "Create"
    ]
  }
]
```

#### OpenApiMetadata

An Ed-Fi API implementation _should_ declare itself in OpenAPI; the version of
OpenAPI is up to the implementation. All Read-Only data must be labeled using
the OpenAPI specification.

The OpenAPI specification must be a faithful representation of all available
resources supported by the API. A given API application might support multiple
specifications, for example one for core Ed-Fi data model resources, and one for
Ed-Fi descriptors.

#### OAuth

The OAuth URL must be the token URL used by clients for authentication. The URL
is not required to be on the same base address, i.e. it could be hosted on
another server.

#### DataManagementApi

This URL represents the base path for constructing the full URL to access a
resource. To this base path, a client appends the data model namespace.
