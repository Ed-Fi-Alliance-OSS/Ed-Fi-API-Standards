# Discovery API

The default response when retrieving the base endpoint on an Ed-Fi
implementation must be a JSON document that provides information about the
application version, supported data model(s), and URLs for additional metadata.
Historically, this root-level metadata resource was known as the "version
endpoint".

> [!TIP]
> The Discovery API is completely described in an
> [Open API 3 specification document](../../../api-specifications/discovery-api/).

The following sample JSON demonstrates a typical example of the document:

```json
{
    "version": "7.1",
    "informationalVersion": "7.1",
    "suite": "3",
    "build": "7.1.1294.0",
    "dataModels": [
        {
            "name": "Ed-Fi",
            "version": "5.0.0",
            "informationalVersion": "The Ed-Fi Data Model 5.0"
        },
        {
            "name": "TPDM",
            "version": "1.1.0",
            "informationalVersion": "TPDM-Core"
        }
    ],
    "urls": {
        "dependencies": "https://api.ed-fi.org/v7.1/api/metadata/data/v3/dependencies",
        "openApiMetadata": "https://api.ed-fi.org/v7.1/api/metadata/",
        "oauth": "https://api.ed-fi.org/v7.1/api/oauth/token",
        "dataManagementApi": "https://api.ed-fi.org/v7.1/api/data/v3/"
    }
}
```

The example above is based on [version
1.0](../../../api-specifications/discovery/1.0/) specification, used by the
Ed-Fi ODS/API Platform. New Ed-Fi API implementations are encouraged to look
into the modifications in the [draft version
2.0](../../../api-specifications/discovery/2.0-draft/).

## Root-Level Information

The root-level information (in this example, `version`, `informationalVersion`,
`suite`, and `build`) describes the deployed application. If the application
complies with these design guidelines and the relevant API specification, then
most _client applications_ should not need to know which _server_ application it
is communicating with. However, this information can be valuable when debugging
the client-server interaction.

## Data Models

This section lists all of the Data Models that are served by this API
application. This will always include the core Ed-Fi (Unifying) Data Model.
Other models listed are the _extensions_ that a given deployment implements. The
example above shows the core Teacher Preparation Data Model (TPDM) extension.

## URLs Section

The URLs section helps client applications discover for themselves how to
interact with the Ed-Fi API application. The _required_ URLs are further
described in the following sections.

The optional values listed below represent features of the the Ed-Fi ODS/API
Platform. Other applications can add their own URLs as needed.

```json
"xsdMetadata": "https://api.ed-fi.org/v7.0/api/metadata/xsd",
"changeQueries": "https://api.ed-fi.org/v7.0/api/changeQueries/v1/",
"composites": "https://api.ed-fi.org/v7.0/api/composites/v1/",
"identity": "https://api.ed-fi.org/v7.0/api/identity/v2/"
```

### Dependencies

All implementations of an Ed-Fi API _should_ expose an endpoint for dependency
metadata.  This endpoint will provide developers with the data needed to load
resources in the appropriate order. The endpoint _should_ have a JSON
implementation and optional a GraphML implementation.  A sample of the JSON
output is below:

```json
[
  {
    "resource": "/ed-fi/absenceEventCategoryDescriptors",
    "order": 1,
    "operations": [
      "Create"
    ]
  },
  {
    "resource": "/ed-fi/academicHonorCategoryDescriptors",
    "order": 1,
    "operations": [
      "Create"
    ]
  },
  â€¦
  {
    "resource": "/tpdm/surveySectionResponsePersonTargetAssociations",
    "order": 22,
    "operations": [
      "Create"
    ]
  }
]
```

### OpenApiMetadata

An Ed-Fi API implementation _should_ declare itself in OpenAPI; the version of
OpenAPI is up to the implementation. All Read-Only data must be labeled using
the OpenAPI specification.

The OpenAPI specification must be a faithful representation of all available
resources supported by the API. A given API application might support multiple
specifications, for example one for core Ed-Fi data model resources, and one for
Ed-Fi descriptors.

> TODO: might want to disable this!

### OAuth

The OAuth URL must be the token URL used by clients for authentication. The URL
is not required to be on the same base address, i.e. it could be hosted on
another server.

### DataManagementApi

This URL represents the base path for constructing the full [Uniform Resource
Locators](./UNIFORM-RESOURCE-LOCATORS.md) (URL) to a given resource. To this
base path, a client appends the data model namespace. For example, the
`/ed-fi/students` resource can be reached at the URL formed by combining the
`dataManagementApi` URL with the resource information. From the example above,
this yields the URL `https://api.ed-fi.org/v7.1/api/data/v3/ed-fi/students`.
While the Ed-Fi ODS/API Platform uses "data/v3" in the URL, any implementation
could use different path segments.

## Application Settings

The draft 2.0 specifications will introduce a section for listing application
settings that could be useful for client application self-discovery. These may
include standard settings such as:

* Default page size for `GET` requests.
* Case sensitivity.
* ETags support.
* ... and more.
