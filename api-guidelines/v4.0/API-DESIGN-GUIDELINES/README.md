# API Design Guidelines

An API is essentially an interface used by programmers to support communication
between systems. Guidelines are useful because the REST architectural style
allows for a great deal of flexibility in design. The guidelines that follow are
designed to make Ed-Fi API implementations intuitive and easy to use for
programmers.

This section covers the following topics in detail:

* [Resources](RESOURCES.md)
* [Discovery API](./DISCOVERY-API.md)
* [Ed-Fi Descriptors](./ED-FI-DESCRIPTORS.md)
* [REST API Conventions](./REST-API.md)
  * [Uniform Resource Locators (URLs)](./UNIFORM-RESOURCE-LOCATORS.md)
  * [Data Strictness](./DATA-STRICTNESS.md)
  * [POST Requests](./POST-REQUESTS.md)
  * [GET Requests](./GET-REQUESTS.md)
  * [PUT Requests](./PUT-REQUESTS.md)
  * [DELETE Requests](./DELETE-REQUESTS.md)
