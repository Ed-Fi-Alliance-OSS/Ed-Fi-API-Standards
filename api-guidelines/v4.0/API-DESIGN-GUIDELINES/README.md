# API Design Guidelines v3.1

An API is essentially an interface used by programmers to support communication
between systems. Guidelines are useful because the REST architectural style
allows for a great deal of flexibility in design. The guidelines that follow are
designed to make Ed-Fi API implementations intuitive and easy to use for
programmers.

This section covers the following topics in detail:

  * [Discover API](DISCOVERY-API.md)
  * [Data Strictness](DATA-STRICTNESS.md)
  * [Resources](RESOURCES.md)
  * [HTTP Verbs](HTTP-VERBS.md)
  * [General Request Construction](GENERAL-REQUEST-CONSTRUCTION.md)
  * [Ed-Fi Descriptors](ED-FI-DESCRIPTORS.md)
  * [Query Operators](QUERY-OPERATORS.md)
  * [Response Codes](RESPONSE-CODES.md)
  * [ETags and Other REST API Conventions and
  Features](ETAGS-OTHER-CONVENTIONS.md)
