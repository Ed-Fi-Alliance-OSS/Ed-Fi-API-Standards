# Requirement Levels

The sections that follow contain guidelines for Ed-Fi API designs and
implementations. Certain key terms have specific meanings in these
guidelines.[\[1\]](#f1) From this point forward, key terms are italicized when
used with the specific meanings shown below:

* _Must, required, shall._ These terms indicate an absolute requirement for an
  aligned Ed-Fi API implementation.
* _Must not, shall not._ These terms indicate an absolute prohibition for an
  aligned Ed-Fi API implementation.
* _Should, recommended._ These terms indicate that there may be valid reasons to
  ignore a particular item, but the full implications must be understood and
  carefully weighed before choosing a different course.
* _Should not, not recommended._ These terms indicate that there may be
  circumstances when a particular behavior is acceptable or useful, but the full
  implications should be understood and the case carefully weighed before
  implementing such behavior.
* _May, could, optional._ These terms indicate items that are truly optional.
  One organization may choose to include the item because their specific
  implementation requires it or because they feel it enhances the
  implementation, while another organization may omit the item. Client
  applications must be prepared to interoperate with an implementation that does
  not include the option, although perhaps with reduced functionality. In the
  same vein, a client who does include a particular option must be prepared to
  interoperate with another implementation that does not include the option.
* _Aligned._ An aligned implementation meets all the "must, required, shall"
  requirements of these guidelines, and avoids the "must not, shall not"
  prohibitions.
