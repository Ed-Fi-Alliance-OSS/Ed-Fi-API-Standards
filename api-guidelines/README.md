# API Guidelines

* [v3.1](v3.1) - current, applies to ODS/API 3.x through 7.x

This section provides design guidelines for an Ed-Fi representational state
transfer (REST) application programming interface (API). These guidelines
describe the properties to which an API specification and related implementation
must adhere in order to be considered aligned to Ed-Fi technology standards.
They are guidelines only. They do not describe a specific implementation or
particular API specification. Where helpful, a rationale for specific guidelines
is also provided.
