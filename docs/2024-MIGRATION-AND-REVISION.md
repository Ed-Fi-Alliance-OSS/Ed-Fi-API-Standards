# 2024 Migration and Revision Project

## Goals

In support of a strategic goal of moving the Ed-Fi Alliance technical suite to
an "API-first" development model:

1. Migrate the following content from Ed-Fi Tech Docs to a GitHub repository:
   1. API Design Guidelines
   2. Official (Open API) specifications
   3. RFCs
2. Produce revision 4.0 of the [Ed-Fi API Guidelines](../api-guidelines/).
3. Revise domain-specific RFCs and API guidance (e.g. dealing with the Survey
   API).

> [!TIP]
> What do we mean by "API-first"? In a literal sense, the Ed-Fi Data Standard
> and its Unifying Data Model (UDM) will continue to drive generation of the API
> specifications. Historically, the API specification was only available after
> the Data Standard updates were integrated into the Ed-Fi ODS/API Platform,
> meaning that feedback on the revised specification could not come until after
> publishing an update to the ODS/API Platform.
>
> Taking a more API-first approach means publishing proposed specifications
> before an implementation is available, i.e. before updating the ODS/API
> Platform. It also means taking greater care to document what it takes for
> _anyone_ to build an API application and label it as "an Ed-Fi API" or as
> "Ed-Fi compatible".
